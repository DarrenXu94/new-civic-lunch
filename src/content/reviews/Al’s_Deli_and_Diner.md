Schnitzel Sandwich - $18

This small hole in the wall was actually extremely busy on a Tuesday at 12:30pm. There was only two seats left in the whole shop (albeit the shop could probably only take like 10 people) but there were many patrons waiting outside for their order. 

I got the schnitzel sandwich and it was comical. The chicken was gigantic and the bun was miniscule. Normally I hate brioche buns due to the lack of integrity and in this case it was emphasized even more due to the schnitzel size. Once I ate down to the bun there was some nice sauce, but I wish there was more.

This place also pretty much had the same menu as Bad Bunny and was just better.

Rating: A-
