This new restaurant opened a couple of doors down from where I work so I thought Iâ€™d check it out. I was the lunch deals on the outside and was immediately intrigued. $20 stone grill steak, $16 bangers and mash, $17 steak burger. Heck I was impressed.

I got the stonegrill steak and gad dam it was good. Perfectly cooked due to the chef of course. Yummy chips and actually generous serve of salad.

This place will be very popular soon and I imagine the prices are some sort of introductory offer, but as of this moment this is TOP TIER.
