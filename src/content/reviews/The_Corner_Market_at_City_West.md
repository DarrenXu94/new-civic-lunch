Honestly I wasnâ€™t planning on ever coming to this place for lunch but I needed to grab something quick today. This wasnâ€™t my first time here however. I frequent this place most weeks for their fresh cooked cinnamon donuts. Iâ€™ve probably bought more than 50 donuts from here by now (Iâ€™ve only started coming for afternoon donuts a few months ago). The donuts are NEK LEVEL. If you come early enough theyâ€™ll make it for you fresh.

But onto the lunch for today. I got a toasted chicken sandwich for $11. I wasnâ€™t expecting much. But god dam. That shit has no right to be that good. Sure it wasnâ€™t top tier ingredients or amount but the flavours were banging. The bread wasnâ€™t standard bullshit white loaf, it was like turkish bread with seeds and shit. Very pleasantly surprised for a place that looks bang average attached to a supermarket.

Iâ€™m giving this low A as it had great price point as well as convenience, but also wouldnâ€™t call it fancy. No area to sit down either.
