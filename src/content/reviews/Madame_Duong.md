Brand new restaurant alert! At the time of writing this place isn‚Äôt even on GOOGLE MAPS.

This place opened when the old iPho on Marcus Clark used to be. RIP

The inside looks exactly the same as before, plenty of seating and generally good vibes.

I got the broken rice with pork for $19. Very tasty and very filling. It came with pickled carrots (meh), cucumber (meh), shit loads of rice, dipping sauce and 2 pork pieces (fkn tasteh).

Would defs come back to try other things on the menu.
