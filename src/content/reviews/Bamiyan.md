Bamiyan, more like BamiYUM am I right? Bamiyan is a cute lil Afghan shop that serves tasty meats. Iâ€™ve been here a few times at lunch and itâ€™s always quiet, no idea why because the food slaps hard.

Today we got the Kabuli Pallow with lamb which is like oily rice with lamb chunks; and lemme say this rice is some of the tastiest rice Iâ€™ve had. And Iâ€™m Chinese. It also came with a curry which was noice but not mind blowing.

The Afghan Testy plate (wtf is that?) is just a collection of various meats, naan and salads. It had chicken, beef, dumplings, bread, 2 sauces and salad. Probably wouldnâ€™t get this again but it was nice to try all the different items. The dumplings were a stand out.

10/10 quantity but not sure if that was because we spent 32 bucks each. Oh well yolo
