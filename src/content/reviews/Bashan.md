Chinese style restaurant

Got the Dandan noodles and spicy pork ear.

$16 for noodles, $12 for pork ear.

Noodles were very hot (temperature) and v tasty. The mince was super oily and kinda felt gross eating it. Next time Iâ€™d order like noodles plus some vege or something to soak up the oil probs.

Rating: A
