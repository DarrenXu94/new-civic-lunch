Malatang is a cute lil Chinese Subway equivalent with soupy noodles instead of a bread roll. There are two Malatang restaurants located one shop apart located just outside the main civic area. These two restaurants literally share the same kitchen so I’m doing a TWO for ONE review deal.

The process of grabbing your own ingredients is fun because depending on the day you could end up with a reasonable $18 dollar meal or a disgusting $35 feast (both have happened to me). My favourite ingredients to add are bacon, mushrooms, instant noodles and every type of thinly shaved meat (great flavour to weight ratio). There are multiple types of soup to choose from (mushroom and mega spicy maybe?) but I have no idea how the ones apart from original spicy taste cause I’ve never bothered to try. There are also a plethora of condiments to add to the top as well to micro-adjust your flavours (the crispy chickpeas are like an asian crouton).

The water tap in one of the restaurants has an intentionally slow fill rate causing you to get frustrated and buy soft drinks instead to calm the heat of the soup in your mouth. That’s sneaky.

This is probably one of my favourite lunchtime places to go as you can always get the right amount of food you want and it tastes amazing.
