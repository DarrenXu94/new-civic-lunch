This cute lil hole in the wall restaurant provides a quick n seemingly healthy meal for a reasonable price. I was initially a bit sus when I saw them scooping rice out of a kmart rice cooker but like, rice is rice so who cares.

You get to choose from 3 dishes from a variety of meats and veg and it comes with rice. I got the chiggen, misc vegetables and roast pumpkin for $13. The flavours were surprisingly strong in a good way, good level of spice. Any more and I would be uncomfortable. 

Gotta take away marks for general vibes though. No real place to sit apart from on the street which is next to a busy road.

Overall acceptable for a quick feed but not too filling.

Rating: B+
