I stumbled upon this spot that had a pretty fun self-ordering system. It’s not something you see too often, so it was a cool little gimmick to try out. Food came out very fast despite how busy it was.

The prices were pretty mid-tier. I ordered the chicken rice, which was 18.80. Portion sizes were decent, so no complaints there. The place had a mixed crowd—lots of students but also plenty of office workers. It was almost full when I got there, which I guess is a good sign.

Overall, a nice little place for a quick, satisfying meal. Dumplings probably wouldn’t get again, left a weird aftertaste in my mouth that lingered all arvo.
