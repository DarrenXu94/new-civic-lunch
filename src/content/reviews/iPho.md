iPho is a cute lil Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of the city. The outdoor sitting area is a visually unappealing area with hoards of magpies swarming and high foot traffic walking past. Thatâ€™s when you know the pho is gonna be lit.

The usual condiments were offered, chilli, basil and that crunchy yellow bean sprout thing. The broth was tasty and meat adequate. I was hoping for a bit more quantity but for $17 itâ€™s not all that bad.
