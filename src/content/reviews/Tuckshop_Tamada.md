Long story short:

Food yummy

Location yucky

The chilli ratings next to their food should be tripled

1 chili = I'm crying

2 chili = send me to the emergency room

I got the beef massaman curry for $15. Very reasonably priced. The box they gave me actually felt very hefty when I got it.

Entrees a bit expenny

Prawn n pork nuggets $10 for 3

Chicken skewers $10 for 3

Location absolutely sucks though. Down an alleyway behind a nightclub.  When I went as well they were pouring concrete so that made it very unpleasant. I don't blame them for that but there was no where to sit or even wait around.

Unfortunately the vibes does detract from the actual good food. Food would probs be A but vibes brings it down to B.
