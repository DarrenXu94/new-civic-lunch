Surprisingly wholesome lunch vibes.

$11 standard lunch, don’t get any choice.

Vegan and gluten free.

Cosy inside seating area with an attached bulk wholefoods shop. The whole vibe was just great. I got here just before 12 and there was no line but soon after I started eating there was a massive line out the door.

I got a lentil soup today with rice and vegetables. Pretty tasty, could have done with a bit more salt. Amount kinda low but price was low so it makes up. Food rating wouldn’t be too high but the vibes brings it up.
