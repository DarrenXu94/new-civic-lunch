Sushi Bell is a cute lil hole in the wall sushi restaurant. I came here today around 12:15 and there was a line of about 4 people. When I finished ordering the line had grown to about 15. This place is popular, and for good reason. The sushi they have here is extremely high quality, different to other varieties you get elsewhere (yeah im fkn looking at u chicken avo roll) and reasonably priced.

I got a tiger roll set for $10 (about 5 or 6 rolls) and then got 3 different individual sushis, vege, scallop and grilled fish. They were all extremely tasty.

Not that many seating options but if you get in early you can sit inside on the benches or on the outside tables.
