Every time I walk past this place it is chocca bloc full of people so I had high expectations. The restaurant is pretty new and Iâ€™ve always wanted to try it. I normally love mexican food but this place was pretty meh to me.

I got the chicken burrito and it was probs 90% rice and beans with no sauce. All the sauce pooled to the bottom which made the base soggy. It was a decent size though and with a side of chips it kept me full. It cost $22 with avo (cause Iâ€™m not a pleb).

The drinks apparently were good and the vibe was decent. Staff were friendly but we kept asking them to close the door that letting in the cold winter air.

Would I go again? Maybe for like after work drinks or something, not at lunch.
