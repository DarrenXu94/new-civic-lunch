Marvie and Wolfe is a cute lil cafe who apparently makes all their food from scratch (eg sauces and breads). They have a rotating menu and today I was lucky enough to try the grilled chicken salad.

The food came out very quick (maybe like 5 mins?) and they had seating out the front. Don’t come here with a large group though, maybe like 4 max cause you won’t have anywhere to sit together.

The chicken was very moist and had a nice sauce to go with it. I was very happy with the taste, but I could have eaten twice as much. $16 dollars is also pretty reasonable for a lunch deal but I’d happily pay 50% more for 50% more food.
