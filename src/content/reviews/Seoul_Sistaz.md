Seoul Sistaz is a cute lil Korean cafe/restaurant that just opened up around the corner of my office. The aesthetic inside looks like a korean pinterest board (very cutesey but a lil bit low budget). 

For lunch I got the terriyaki chicken bibimBAP for $20. It came out pretty quick and was quite tasty. Good serving size left me satisfied but not exploding with food. Very keen to come back and try the Korean fried chiggen.
