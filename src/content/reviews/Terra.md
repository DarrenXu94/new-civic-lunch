Lunch deal $26 bucks

Protein and 2 sides

Terra is a cute lil Western style BBQ restaurant. It is located a bit further out the city center but still an easy walk (10 min?). The service style is kinda like a cafeteria if the cafeteria was boujee.

Today I got the beef brisket with miso chapped potatoes and pasta salad with some miso gravy on the side. The brisket was absolutely melt in yo mouf amazing. So tender and juicy, it was perfectly paired with the gravy. The potatoes were also very smashable with crispy skin and creamy miso sauce.

All in all the meal was very filling. The $26 price tag is a bit on the high side but it’s definitely worth the splash.
