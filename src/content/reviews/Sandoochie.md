Sandoochie (AKA Le Dooch) is a cute lil sandwich shop offering home made sandwiches on fresh baked bread. The menu appears to be rotating as there were 4 sandwiches on display today. I tried both the Turkey and Eggplant schnitzel sandwiches.

Thoughts:

- you better love cheese cause itâ€™s creamy. Luckily I do love cheese.

- quite small and not quite filling enough. Maybe get 2 if youâ€™re hungry.

- flavours were exciting and different

- expensive

Would recommend eggplant schnit
