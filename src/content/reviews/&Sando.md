Steak Sanga $25

&Sando is a new sandwich restaurant apparently run by Matt Moran. I visited week 2 after it’s opening and there was still a huge line. I decided to order the most expensive thing on the mean as I assumed it would be the best. They didn’t have any so I had to wait another 15 mins on top on the line wait.

After receiving the sandwich there was no seating around as well. Not very convenient. 

Now onto the actual sandwich.

Bread: Rock hard

Steak: Really chewy

Other ingredients: Pretty tasty and moist

Would I go there again? No. For $25 bucks I’d go to literally anywhere else for a sandwich.

Rating: B
