O﻿MI is a cute lil Japanese restaurant located outside where I normally get yelled at by homeless people. The restaurant has a fat Japandi vibe (look it up it’s a real term) and even let me sit on the comfy squishy couches at a four person table where there were only two of us.

E﻿very day there is a new lunch deal. Today I went on pork deal day for $18 (+2 for extra egg). What I thought was real cool was the amount of customisation you could do for your meal. You could choose noodles or rice, what sauce, extra egg and a free drink (only on the daily deal). The drinks included tea or exotic soft drinks.

I﻿ got the pork with rice, Japanese curry sauce, extra fried egg and herbal tea. Everything tasted great except the tea. That tasted like dirt. The meat was cooked perfectly, there was a good amount of rice and I loved the sauce. I was defs full after but not food coma levels.

T﻿he staff were actually super polite and helpful too so kudos for dat.
