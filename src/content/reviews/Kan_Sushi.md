Kan you feel it? It's a great deal! 

I have frequented Kan many times (probs over 50) before but will limit my review to this specific outing. I got the $20 meal deal with katsu chicken. It contained:

- Generous, very juicy and yummy chicken

- Mid tier miso soup

- Bowl of rice

- Afterthought salad

Great speed and service with the food brought out to the table in usually under 5 mins. $20 is pretty standard on the pricing but the quality of the food seems to be pretty high.
