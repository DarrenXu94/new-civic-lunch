More like REEEâ€™s sushi. Damn this place is disappointing and yet white people love it. If you donâ€™t come just when they make a fresh roll the seaweed is chewy and old af. Somehow the salmon tastes rubbery as well. The price is just crazy, probably around $16 for 3 rolls. Iâ€™m not even full after that and 80% of it is white rice anyway. Zero nutritional value.

Another thing, hardly any seating. The seating provided as just some shittty ass chairs exposed to the elements. Tables are also uneven go GL if you get a curry.
