Combination ramen bowl with prawn tempura, char shui pork and corn. $18

Cheap af lunch spot. Get in early cause students froth this place apparently. 

Ramen soup was very yummy albeit a bit salty. Pork was delightful. Prawn was ok, I don't understand why you gotta put it in the soup and let it get soggy af.

Good price, good flavours, moderate vibes.
