TÔªøaki is a quaint lil o Japanese restaurant located in the new fancy schmancy wannabe Chinatown of civic. It looks super sleek and modern from outside. I visited this fine establishment for a romantic workplace lunch date on valentines day.

IÔªø decided to order the lunch deal as I was overwhelmed by the regular menu and I have a low attention span. The deal I ordered was a salmon donburi. This consisted of:

- bowl of flavoursome rice

- some fresh and generous amount of salmon sashimi

- some beans and other misc toppins I couldn‚Äôt name

- generic miso soup

- cheap salad with a surprisingly tasty dressing

TÔªøotal price: 23 dolla

TÔªøhe taste was actually very yum. Downside is I could have eaten probably another bowl. I would recommend for people with fine taste that don‚Äôt eat a lot. Not like me, I got a scroll from Baker‚Äôs Delight after to tie me over hehe.
