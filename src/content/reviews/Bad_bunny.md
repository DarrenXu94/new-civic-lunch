Bad bunny is a cute lil burger shop. From the outside it has a kinda tacky gross neon theme but inside was actually surprisingly clean. Iâ€™ve always avoided this place because it reminded my of Milky Lane and I HATED Milky Lane (Rest in Pieces).

Now, onto the food. The meal was a surprisingly large portion size. I got a beef and pickle sandwich with a side of chips, for a total of $19. Chips were salty and crisp and the sandwich was reasonably tasty, could do with a bit more sauce though, kinda dry in sections.
