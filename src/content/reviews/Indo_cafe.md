Lunch deal $10

This place always had long lines out the front at lunch so I decided to check it out. There were about 10 or so different lunch items to get and I got two cause I was hungry and they were only $10 each. I got the curry chicken and nasi goreng. Both were 95% rice. Flavours were ok but I know this had no nutritional value at all.
