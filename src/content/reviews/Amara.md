Dis shit lit. Lunch deal curry + rice + naan for 21 bucks plus SPECIAL INTRO PRICE 10% off.

For the curry deal you could get your usual meat curries like butter chicken, lamb rogan, tiki masala or vego options like palak paneer. My partner and I shared the butter chick and palak paneer.

The naan portions were very generous and freshly made. The paneer was a good level of spicy, good for sharing. Butter chicken is butter chicken so can‚Äôt go wrong. Great service as well.
