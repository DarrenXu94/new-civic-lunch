Biang biang is a cute lil noodle restuarant in the heart of the city. It was the cheapest lunch meal I’ve reviewed so far with a measly $16 noodle feed. I can’t remember what I ordered exactly but it was like mince, shredded pork or beef and thicc noodles.

The thicc noodles are a hit. They soak up the spicy sauce extremely well. Be careful eating with a white shirt though as the shlurps will cause big splashbacks.
