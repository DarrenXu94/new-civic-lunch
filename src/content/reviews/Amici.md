I was sceptical about lunchtime sandbos since I got ripped off at &sando but this place has redeemed the humble sandwich

$18 for a Reuben toasted

Came with crisps and cornichons (mini pickles)

I didn't touch the crisps, seems just like smith's, almost insulting

Sandwich was very tasty, high quality ingredients, saucy, not too oily
