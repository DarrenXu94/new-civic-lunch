Fish shack is a cute lil hut serving up tasty seafood and vegan options. Location is kinda weird cause itâ€™s on the side of the road with moderate traffic flow but also pretty central and easy to walk to. I appreciate the cute ocean artwork around the building.

Today I got the snack pack, normally on Wednesdays they have an ocean basket for like $12 but I came on the wrong day. Snack pack included various seafoods which I shall rate now:

- Battered barra x3: S tier

- Calimari rings x2: A tier

- Squid tentacle chewy thing x1? (might have been a freebie?): C tier

- Prawns x2: S tier

- Chips x75: A tier (so many I couldnâ€™t finish)

I would have also liked a lot more tartare sauce, that would have probably bumped the rating up to S, but alas, they will have to settle for high A.

Rating: A+
