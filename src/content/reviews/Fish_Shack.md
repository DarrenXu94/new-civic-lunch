Fish shack is a cute lil hut serving up tasty seafood and vegan options. Location is kinda weird cause itâ€™s on the side of the road with moderate traffic flow but also pretty central and easy to walk to. I appreciate the cute ocean artwork around the building.

Today I got the snack pack, normally on Wednesdays they have an ocean basket for like $12 but I came on the wrong day. Snack pack included various seafoods which I shall rate now:

I would have also liked a lot more tartare sauce, that would have probably bumped the rating up to S, but alas, they will have to settle for high A.

Rating: A+
