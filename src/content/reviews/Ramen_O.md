Ramen $24

Ramen O is a reasonably popular chain of ramen restaurants with one recently opening up in the city. I had high expectations and they were actually met. The pork pieces were very tender and juicy, the soup very flavoursome and good portion size. This would almost be S tier if their noodles were slightly nicer.
