Chop chop, more like cheap cheap

Pretty whelmed by the food at this place 

Lunch express set was 29 bucks

It came with:

- Small beans (edamame)

- Miso in a shot glass

- 3 small misc sushi cubes

- 3 dumps

- 3 small salmon shlices 

That is no food at all. For almost 30 bucks I'm expecting to be hobbling back to my chair. Wasn't wowed by the flavours but it also wasn't bland,  passable I guess.

Service was ok, person was nice but they gave weird tasting flat sparkling water. Not pleasant

Comfy couches thou but that ain't saving this rating
